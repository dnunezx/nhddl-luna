</p>

LUNA (Layered Unified Neutrino Architecture) is a visual PS2 loader derived from NHDDL. The most recent hardware ELF from this working tree is designated the Release Candidate.

LUNA retains NHDDL's Neutrino-launching core: it scans MMCE, APA or _FAT/exFAT-formatted_ BDM devices for ISO files, lists them, and boots the selected ISO via Neutrino. It adds LUNA branding, five PS2 Glass library views, paired cover/disc artwork, PSBBN artwork, and direct in-game return.

This designation does not replace the physical-console safety gates documented in [`../PROJECT.md`](../PROJECT.md). No Git tag or hosted release is implied by the local RC label.

It displays visual Game ID to trigger per-title settings on the Pixel FX line of products and triggers per-title memory cards on SD2PSX and MemCard PRO2.

Note that this not an attempt at making a Neutrino-based Open PS2 Loader replacement.  
Since NHDDL only launches Neutrino, PADEMU, IGR, IGS, cheats and other features supported by OPL are _out-of-scope_ unless they are implemented in Neutrino.

## Usage

Press **Start** in the game library to open LUNA's main menu. Choose **File
Manager** to browse connected storage and memory cards, **Return to Library**
to go back, **Exit LUNA** to quit, or **Shutdown** to power off the console.
The same menu appears automatically when no games are found.

The file manager has two independent panes for copying files and folders between
devices. **L1/R1** or **Left/Right** widens and selects a pane; press the same
direction again to restore equal widths. **Up/Down** selects an item,
**Cross** opens a device or folder, and **Triangle** goes up. Mark up to 128
source items with **Square**, including items in different folders. Open the
destination folder in the other pane, then press **Start** and **Cross** to
confirm a copy. **R2** opens actions for Details, Rename, New Folder, and Move
marked items. The on-screen keyboard uses **Up/Down/Left/Right** to choose a
character, **Cross** to type, **Square** for a space, **Triangle** to delete,
**R1** to change case, and **Start** to save. In the portable PCSX2 profile,
use the arrow keys to choose characters, **K** to type, and **Enter** to save;
typing letters directly on the PC keyboard does not enter a filename.
When a destination name exists, choose Skip, Keep Both, or Replace. Skip leaves
the item marked. A move verifies the copied data before removing its source.
**Select** clears the queue after confirmation. The transfer shows overall
percentage, copied size, speed, and estimated time remaining.
**Circle** cancels measurement or copying and leaves unfinished items queued;
outside a transfer it exits the file manager. Completed items leave the queue.
Copies are staged on the destination; Replace keeps a temporary backup until
the new copy is installed. Details shows the full path, size, and available
space on PFS partitions and memory cards. Other drivers may not report free
space. File sizes appear when the device reports them, including files in `/VMC`;
copying does not change VMC assignments. On an APA HDD it shows the mounted OPL
metadata partition, not the raw game partitions.

The Virtual Memory Cards manager and per-game card picker use enabled local
storage: exFAT HDD, USB, MX4SIO, iLink, or the mounted APA/PFS metadata partition.
Create and assign cards on the game's own drive. Disabling a storage source
hides it from the manager without deleting its cards or per-game assignments;
re-enabling it restores access. Saved card paths follow the drive if its
`mass` mount number changes. PFS cards also retain the correct path when OPL
metadata lives under `pfs0:/OPL`. MMCE uses its automatic hardware card switch
only while MMCE storage is enabled. UDPFS has no file-card creation or picker;
the Physical card choice remains available.

### Classic title list controls

 - Press **Up** on the d-pad to select the **previous title** in the list
 - Press **Down** on the d-pad to select the **next title** in the list
 - Press **L2** to switch to the **previous page** or go to the **start of the list**
 - Press **R2** to switch to the **next page** or go to the **end of the list**

In every library view, hold **R1** to open the quick menu. Use **Up/Down**
while holding R1 and **Cross** to confirm. Releasing R1 closes without choosing.
The menu offers Show Favorites/Show All, Add/Remove from Favorites, Options,
and Random in Orbit, sliding in from the right. While holding R1, **Select**
switches the filter, **Square** adds/removes a favorite, **Triangle** opens
Options, and **R3** starts Random in Orbit. **Select** alone remains a shortcut
to switch the favorites filter.
The footer uses one row: View, Launch, Menu, More.

Press **Triangle** to open the options menu. **Per-game settings** opens the
selected game's launch controls; **Global settings** contains **Classic art
layout**. Press **Cross** or **Circle** to switch between **Separate** (cover
above the disc) and **Overlap** (cover in front of the disc's lower half), then
press **Start** to save. The layout applies to Classic for the whole library on
that drive. **Triangle** cancels an unsaved change and returns to the menu.

In Luna's Collection view, Left/Up and Right/Down move between covers; holding
a direction repeats. Hold L2/R2
to fast scan; quick L2/R2 taps do nothing.

In Luna's Grid view, release a shoulder before half a second for one page. Hold
L2 or R2 for at least half a second to fast-track through lightweight
page shells without loading artwork; releasing loads only the page where the
fast-track stops. That final artwork fills the shell in place without replaying
the page transition.

### Important notes

NHDDL requires a full [Neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) installation to be present at one of the following paths:
- `<NHDDL launch directory>/neutrino.elf` (__might be case-sensitive__ depending on device)
- `massX:/neutrino/neutrino.elf` (BDM devices, if any of BDM modes are enabled)
- `hdd0:/<OPL partition>/neutrino/neutrino.elf` (APA device, if HDL mode is enabled)  
  `OPL partition` is read from `hdd0:__common/OPL/conf_hdd.cfg`, with `+OPL` or `__common/OPL` used as a fallback
- `mmceX:/neutrino/neutrino.elf` (MMCE devices, will work even if MMCE mode is _not_ enabled unless MX4SIO mode is set)
- `mcX:/APPS/neutrino/neutrino.elf` (memory cards, __case-sensitive__)
- `mcX:/NEUTRINO/NEUTRINO.ELF` (SAS-compliant path on memory cards, __case-sensitive__)
- `mcX:/NEUTRINO/neutrino.elf` (SAS-compliant path on memory cards, __case-sensitive__)

By default, NHDDL tries to initialize all supported devices. You can override this behavior and reduce initialization times by setting specific mode in launcher configuration file.  
See [this](#launcher-configuration-file) section for details on `nhddl.yaml`.  

On startup, NHDDL attempts to detect its launch device from the ELF path and initializing only the necessary drivers for that device type.  
It then searches for `nhddl.yaml` in the same directory or `/nhddl/nhddl.yaml` on that device.  
If no configuration file is found, NHDDL defaults to loading all supported devices except MX4SIO.

If Neutrino is running from a virtual memory card on an MMCE device, NHDDL will not mount the per-game virtual memory card.

**Do not plug in any BDM storage devices while running NHDDL!**  
Doing so might crash NHDDL and/or possibly corrupt the files on your target device due to how BDM drivers work.

#### Manual installation

To use NHDDL:
- Get the [latest `nhddl.elf`](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl/releases)
- Copy `nhddl.elf` to your memory card or storage device wherever you want.
- _Additional step if you need only some of the available modes or MX4SIO support_:  
  1. Modify `nhddl.yaml` [accordingly](#launcher-configuration-file) and copy it next to `nhddl.elf`.  
  See notes on [the configuration file](#launcher-configuration-file) for more information
  2. When loading NHDDL from APA or BDM, there is no reliable way to get modes from `nhddl.yaml`.  
  You can [rename the ELF](#forcing-a-specific-mode-via-the-nhddl-elf-file-name) to force a specific mode
- Get the [latest Neutrino release](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino/releases)
- Copy Neutrino folder to the root of your PS2 memory card or your storage device. 

#### Save Application System PSU

You can also get NHDDL as an easy-to-use PSU package [here](https://pcm720.github.io/nhddl-psu/).  
To install it:
- Copy generated `nhddl.psu` to your USB drive
- Open wLaunchELF on your PS2
- Choose your USB device and copy `nhddl.psu`
- Go back and open your memory card (`mc0` or `mc1`)
- Open file menu and select `psuPaste`
- Get the [latest Neutrino release](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino/releases)
- Copy Neutrino folder to the root of your PS2 memory card or your storage device. 

This will install NHDDL to your memory card along with the PS2 Browser icon.
 
Updating `nhddl.elf` is as simple as replacing `nhddl.elf` with the latest version.

### Supported modes

#### ATA (MBR/GPT-formatted HDD with exFAT partition)

To skip all other devices, `mode: ata` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

#### MX4SIO

MX4SIO support requires explicit configuration due to conflicts with memory cards and MMCE devices.  
`mode: mx4sio` must be present in `nhddl.yaml` for MX4SIO to be enabled.

Note that __MMCE devices will not be available__ when this mode is enabled, regardless of how it's configured.

#### USB

Using more than one USB mass storage device at the same time is not recommended.
To skip all other devices, `mode: usb` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

#### UDPFS

To skip all other devices, `mode: udpfs` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

UDPFS module requires PS2 IP address to work.  
NHDDL attempts to retrieve PS2 IP address from the following sources:
- `udpfs_ip` flag in `nhddl.yaml`
- `SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT` on the memory card (usually created by w/uLaunchELF via `MISC/Configure/Network Settings...`)

`udpfs_ip` flag takes priority over `IPCONFIG.DAT`.

Make sure to set the IP address in Neutrino config files (as of Neutrino 1.8.0, `config/bsd-udpfs.toml`).  
Consult Neutrino documentation for more details.

Recommended UDPFS server implementations:
- [udpfsd](https://github.com/pcm720/udpfsd) by pcm720
  - More optimized for unattended server and router installations
  - Supports multiple PS2 consoles at a time
  - Does not require Python
- [udpfs-server](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino) by Maximus32
  - Reference Python implementation

#### iLink

iLink support requires explicit configuration.
`mode: ilink` must be present in `nhddl.yaml` for iLink to be enabled.

#### MMCE (SD2PSX, MemCard PRO2)

To skip all other devices, `mode: mmce` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

#### HD Loader (APA-formatted HDD with HDL partitions)

The HDL backend can use an existing 8 MiB VMC file in the mounted APA/PFS
metadata partition's `/VMC` folder. Create or assign one from a game's VMC
options. This requires a matching Neutrino build with PFS VMC support, an
8 KiB PFS zone size, and a file with at most 64 total mapped extents across
the game and card images. Neutrino checks the file mapping before boot and
stops if it cannot validate it. APA/PFS VMC save writes still need a test on
an APA-formatted disk image or console before this is considered verified.
Virtual HDDs are not supported by the HDL backend.

Cover art, `nhddl.yaml` title options will be loaded from the OPL partition set in
`hdd0:__common/OPL/conf_hdd.cfg`, with `+OPL` or `__common/OPL` used as a fallback.

To skip all other devices, `mode: hdl` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.
However, due to how device modules are initialized, this will not improve the initialization times.

### Storing ISO (MMCE, BDM backends)

ISOs can be stored almost anywhere on the storage device, but no more than 5 directories deep.  
For example, ISOs stored in `DVD/A/B/C/D` will be scanned and added to the list, but ISOs stored in `DVD/A/B/C/D/E` will be ignored.  

Furthermore, directories that start with `.`, `$` and the following directories are ignored to speed up the scanning process:
 - `nhddl`
 - `APPS`
 - `ART`
 - `CFG`
 - `CHT`
 - `LNG`
 - `THM`
 - `VMC`
 - `XEBPLUS`
 - `MemoryCards`

### Displaying cover art

NHDDL uses the same file naming convention and file format used by OPL.  
Just put **140x200 PNG** files named `<title ID>_COV.png` (e.g. `SLUS_200.02_COV.png`) into the `ART` directory on the root of your device.  
If unsure where to get your cover art from, check out the latest version of [OPL Manager](https://oplmanager.com).

LUNA's Collection, Grid, and Orbit views use optional **256x256
PNG** artwork named `<title ID>.png` under `ART/PSBBN/`. Use
[OrbitPS2 Manager — LUNA Edition](https://github.com/dnunezx/OrbitPS2-Manager-LUNA-edition)
to obtain and prepare this PSBBN artwork.

### Passing arguments

Similar to Neutrino, NHDDL supports receiving launcher options from `argv` in the `-<arg>=<value>` format.  
Be aware that passing any argument will cause NHDDL to completely skip loading launcher configuration files from any device.  

For example, to initialize NHDDL with UDPFS mode, you can run `nhddl.elf` with `-mode=udpfs` and `-udpfs_ip=192.168.1.6`.  

When `-mode=` is provided, NHDDL initializes the UI first, then loads modules according to the specified mode before scanning for titles.

Add `-noinit` to skip IOP module initialization entirely. Use this only when your bootloader or launcher has already loaded all required device drivers for the specified mode.

See [this file](examples/nhddl.yaml) for a list of all supported arguments and their possible values.

### Forward Boot Mode

When NHDDL is launched with both `-mode=<type>` and `-dvd=<path_to_iso>` arguments, it enters **forward boot mode**, which bypasses the UI entirely and directly launches Neutrino. In this mode:

- Device drivers for the specified mode are initialized automatically
- The target image is located and launched without user interaction
- Use `-noinit` only if your launcher already has the required modules loaded (see [Passing arguments](#passing-arguments))

This behavior allows custom bootloaders or automated scenarios to skip the launcher interface entirely.

### Forcing a specific mode via the NHDDL ELF file name

When loading NHDDL from APA or BDM without argument support, you can add a postfix to the ELF filename to force a specific mode:
- `nhddl-ata.elf` — force ATA mode
- `nhddl-mmce.elf` — force MMCE mode
- `nhddl-hdl.elf` — force HDL mode
- `nhddl-udpfs.elf` — force UDPFS mode
- `nhddl-usb.elf` — force USB mode
- `nhddl-ilink.elf` — force iLink mode
- `nhddl-m4s.elf` — force MX4SIO mode

NHDDL will only initialize the mode specified in the file name and respect all other options from `nhddl.yaml` on the storage device.
When forcing UDPFS mode, make sure you've configured `SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT` on your memory card.

## Configuration files

NHDDL uses YAML-_like_ files to load and store its configuration options.

### Launcher configuration file

Launcher configuration is read from the `nhddl.yaml` file.

Configuration file is loaded from one of the following paths:
- `<NHDDL launch directory>/nhddl.yaml` (__might be case-sensitive__ depending on device)
- `massX:/nhddl/nhddl.yaml` (BDM devices, if any of BDM modes are enabled)
- `hdd0:/<OPL partition>/nhddl/nhddl.yaml` (APA device, if HDL mode is enabled)  
  `OPL partition` is read from `hdd0:__common/OPL/conf_hdd.cfg`, with `+OPL` or `__common/OPL` used as a fallback
- `mmceX:/nhddl/nhddl.yaml` (MMCE devices, will work even if MMCE mode is _not_ enabled unless MX4SIO mode is set)
- `mcX:/APP_NHDDL/nhddl.yaml` (memory cards, __case-sensitive__)

This file is _completely optional_ and must be used only to force video mode in NHDDL UI or set NHDDL device mode.  
By default, default video mode is used and all BDM devices are used to look for ISO files.

To disable a flag, you can just comment it out with `#`.

See [this file](examples/nhddl.yaml) for an example of a valid `nhddl.yaml` file and a list of all supported arguments and possible values.

### Additional configuration files on storage device

LUNA writes ISO-related state and argument files to the `/LUNA` directory in
the root of the BDM drive. Existing files under `/nhddl` remain readable as a
legacy fallback and are not modified during migration.

#### `lastTitle.bin`

This file stores the full path of the last launched title and is used to automatically navigate to it each time NHDDL starts up.  
This file is created automatically.

#### `cache.bin`

Contains title ID cache for all ISOs located during the previous launch, making building ISO list way faster.  
This file is also created automatically.

#### Argument files

These files store arbitrary arguments that are passed to Neutrino on title launch.  
Arguments stored in those files __are passed to `neutrino.elf` as-is__.

Ensure that paths are as short as possible as the combined length of all arguments cannot exceed approximately 255 characters. If this limit is exceeded, arguments will be truncated when passed to Neutrino, potentially causing unpredictable results such as returning to the PS2 menu or ignoring some arguments.  
Note that NHDDL always adds `-bsd=<>`, `-dvd=<full path to ISO>`, and `-qb` arguments to load the title, which reduces the actual allowable length below 255 characters.

_For a list of valid arguments, see Neutrino README._

Example of a valid argument file:
```yaml
# All flags are passed to neutrino as-is for future-proofing, comments are ignored
gc: 2
mc0: /memcard0.bin # all file paths must be relative to device root, the actual mountpoint will be added automatically
$mc1: /VMC/memcard1.bin # this argument is disabled
# Arguments that don't have a value
# Empty values are treated as a simple flag
dbc:
logo:
```

To be able to parse those arguments and allow you to dynamically enable or disable them in UI,  
NHDDL uses a dollar sign (`$`) to mark arguments as enabled or disabled by default.  
Only enabled arguments get passed to Neutrino.

NHDDL supports two kinds of argument files:

#### global.yaml

Arguments stored in `LUNA/global.yaml` are applied to every ISO by default.

#### ISO-specific files

Arguments stored in `LUNA/<ISO name>.yaml` are applied to every ISO that starts with `<ISO name>`.

NHDDL can create this file automatically when title compatibility modes are modified and saved in UI.

#### Favorites

In the Classic view, press Square to add or remove the selected game from Favorites and
press Select to switch between the List and Favorites tabs. Favorite games
are marked with a cyan glass star. The selection is stored as `LUNA/favorites.txt` on the
game's metadata device, so it survives a restart without changing the ISO library.
Collection also exposes a Collection/Favorites selector: press Select there to filter
the cover flow to the same saved favorites.
